Accordingly to the last report (Greenhouse Gas Inventory, 2023) buildings are responsible for more than 40%  of the worldâ€™s resource and energy consumption and around 33% of the total CO2 emissions. 
Buildings of EU countries are regulated by the Energy Performance of Building Directive, which provides that the information about energy performance of buildings are reported in the EPCs (Energy Performance Certificates). Those tools play a key role to reduce energy waste.

The information regarding the energy performance of buildings can be resumed into ten classes (from G to A4). Since the literature has already found cases of bias from certifiers both in the finance field (financial analysts and rating agencies) and public sector, the goal of this research is to verify the absence of bias from certifiers on EPCs. Since those tools will play a fundamental role to drive the energy saving, it is fundamental to verify that the certifier does not impact on the energy class. 

The underlying hyphotesis is that only features inherent to building's feature, suggested interventions and energy performance should impact on the energy class. In order to evaluate if the bias from certifiers exists, I used Multinomial Logistic Regression with lasso penalization (because it consents to handle high dimensional datasets datasets and to perform feature selection), Random Forest and XGBoost (looking at the feature importance).
